Hello Everyone,
In this project I have implemented Rabin Cryptosystem in C++.

_______________
Rabin CryptoSystem:
****************
The Rabin cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptographic technique, whose security, like that of RSA, is related to the difficulty of integer factorization. However the Rabin cryptosystem has the advantage that it has been mathematically proven to be computationally secure against a chosen-plaintext attack as long as the attacker cannot efficiently factor integers, while there is no such proof known for RSA. It has the disadvantage that each output of the Rabin function can be generated by any of four possible inputs; if each output is a ciphertext, extra complexity is required on decryption to identify which of the four possible inputs was the true plaintext.

********************
In this project user will get an option to encrypt the file data is well. In code i have given file name (example.txt) whatever user wants to encrypt. According to that the user can make changes in it.

*********************
In this project user will have 3 choice:
1.) Encrypt from the file

In this option the data of the txt file(example.txt) will get Encrypted and Encrypted data will also get append in the txt file(example.txt) and the user can also see the output in Console.

2.) Decrypt form the file.

In this option the data of the txt file(example.txt) will get Decrypted and the user can also see the output in Console.

3.) Read from console.

In this option whatever user wants to encrypt and decrypt can simply write the query on console and the output will appear on the comnsole.
